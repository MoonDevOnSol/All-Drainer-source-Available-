💡 What Is This?

The Crypto Drainer Simulator is a training tool that mimics how malicious contracts drain wallets across popular blockchains.

It shows how a wallet with anywhere from $2 to $10,000+ in tokens could be compromised instantly — usually without the user realizing until it’s too late.

This project exists to educate, simulate, and protect.
