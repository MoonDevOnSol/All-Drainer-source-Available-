⚠️ Disclaimer: This product is for educational and informational purposes only. Users are responsible for adhering to all applicable laws.

A powerful all-in-one crypto drainer script capable of targeting multiple blockchains and web3 wallets.

This advanced script utilizes smart contracts to drain tokens and NFTs from injected web3 wallets (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, WalletConnect, etc.) and liquidity pools on major DeFi platforms. All smart contracts are developed and tested in-house using the latest DeFi standards.

📌 Types of Available Drainers

Solana Drainer

Tron Drainer

TON Drainer

Multichain (EVM) Drainer

These scripts are often marketed as “all-in-one solutions” capable of interacting with multiple blockchains, smart contracts, and web3 wallets.

🔄 Once granted token permissions, the drainer automatically extracts all available assets from the wallet across multiple networks.

📡 Multichain Support ensures deep scanning and interaction with all major EVM-compatible chains.
